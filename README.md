# Data structures programs  
Data structures programs that I wrote for college (B.Sc. in Computer Science)
I see that a lot of people have trouble writing data structures algorithms.
So I decided to upload my code here, hoping that it would help you understand these concepts better.
Most of these algorithms are improvised and some are my own. Comments would have been nice but the function names are easy to understand imo.
