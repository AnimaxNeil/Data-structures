# Data structure programs  
Data structure programs that I wrote for college (B.Sc. in Computer Science)
I see that a lot of people have trouble writing data structures algorithms.
So I decided to upload my code here, hoping that it would help you understand these concepts better.
Mode of the algorithms are improvisedand some are my own. Sorry for the lack of comments but the function names are easy to understand imo.
